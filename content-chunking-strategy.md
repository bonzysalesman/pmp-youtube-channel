### Chunk Header Template
Each chunk should include:
```markdown
# [Chunk Title]

**Week:** [Week Number]
**Domain:** [People/Process/Business Environment]
**ECO Tasks:** [List of relevant ECO tasks]
**Video References:** 
- ðŸŽ¥ Day [X]: [Video Title] - [Specific topics covered]

**Study Guide Sections:** [Original section numbers from source.md]
**Estimated Reading Time:** [X minutes]
**Key Learning Outcomes:** [Bullet points]

---

[Content begins here]
```

### Cross-Reference System
1. **Video Callouts in Chunks:**
   - `ðŸŽ¥ **Watch Day 8:** Team Ground Rules in Action`
   - `ðŸŽ¯ **Practice Session:** Apply conflict resolution techniques`
   - `ðŸ“Š **Week Review:** Test your team building knowledge`

2. **Study Guide References in Videos:**
   - "Read pages 45-52 in your study guide for detailed examples"
   - "Complete the activity on page 67 before tomorrow's lesson"
   - "Review the conflict resolution framework in Section 1.1"

### Content Synchronization Rules

1. **ECO Task Alignment:** Each chunk must map to specific ECO tasks covered in corresponding videos
2. **Progressive Complexity:** Chunks build on previous knowledge, matching video progression
3. **Practice Integration:** Each chunk includes practice elements that align with video practice sessions
4. **Cross-Domain Connections:** Highlight relationships between People, Process, and Business Environment domains

## Quality Assurance for Chunking

### Content Validation Checklist
- [ ] Each chunk aligns with corresponding week's video content
- [ ] ECO tasks are properly mapped and referenced
- [ ] Learning objectives match between chunk and videos
- [ ] Practice elements are consistent across formats
- [ ] Cross-references are accurate and functional
- [ ] Chunk length is appropriate for weekly study load

### Educational Coherence Checks
- [ ] Concepts build logically from week to week
- [ ] Domain percentages are maintained (People 42%, Process 50%, Business 8%)
- [ ] PMP mindset is consistently reinforced
- [ ] Real-world examples align between written and video content

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation Chunks (Weeks 1-4)
- Critical for establishing learning framework
- Includes introduction, mindset, and team building basics
- Supports early video production and community launch

### Phase 2: Core Content Chunks (Weeks 5-10)
- Covers main Process domain content
- Aligns with "doing the work" phase of program
- Requires careful ECO task mapping

### Phase 3: Integration & Preparation Chunks (Weeks 11-13)
- Business environment and exam preparation focus
- Synthesizes learning from previous weeks
- Supports final preparation and confidence building

## Success Metrics for Chunking Strategy

1. **Content Integration Effectiveness:**
   - Cross-reference usage rates between chunks and videos
   - User feedback on content alignment and flow

2. **Learning Progression:**
   - Completion rates for chunk + video combinations
   - Knowledge retention between weekly assessments

3. **Exam Preparation Quality:**
   - Correlation between chunk engagement and practice exam scores
   - User confidence levels throughout 13-week progression

This chunking strategy ensures that the 700+ page study guide becomes an integrated part of the learning experience rather than a separate resource, supporting our goal of creating a comprehensive PMP certification preparation ecosystem.
