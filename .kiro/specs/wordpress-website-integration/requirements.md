# WordPress Website Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the PMP Course WordPress website (built with Understrap child theme) into our comprehensive analytics and automation system. The integration will enable seamless data flow between the website, our existing analytics systems, YouTube channel automation, and business intelligence dashboard.

The WordPress site features custom course management, e-commerce functionality, user dashboards, and marketing-focused design elements. Integration will provide complete visibility into the customer journey from website visitor to course purchaser, enabling data-driven decision making and automated business processes.
