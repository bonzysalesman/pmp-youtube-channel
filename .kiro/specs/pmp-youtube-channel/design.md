# Design Document

## Overview

The PMP Certification Preparation Ecosystem is designed as an integrated educational platform that transforms PMP exam preparation from an expensive, fragmented experience into an accessible, comprehensive learning system. The platform combines a 700+ page ECO-focused study guide with a structured 13-week YouTube video series, multi-platform community engagement, and automated content management systems.

The design follows a holistic approach: establishing credibility through authentic positioning and professional content, delivering consistent value through integrated written and video materials, building engaged communities across multiple platforms, implementing robust quality assurance for educational accuracy, and creating sustainable monetization through diverse revenue streams. This creates a scalable business model that serves learners while maintaining educational integrity and community focus.

Key architectural principles include content integration across formats, educational quality assurance aligned with PMI standards, multi-platform community management, comprehensive analytics for learning effectiveness, and flexible business model adaptation based on community feedback and market evolution.
