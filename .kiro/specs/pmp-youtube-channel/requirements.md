# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves creating a comprehensive PMP certification preparation ecosystem that integrates a 700+ page study guide with a structured 13-week YouTube video series, multi-platform community engagement, and automated content management systems. The platform will serve as a complete educational solution for project managers seeking PMP certification, combining written materials, daily study videos, practice content, and community support to create a sustainable and scalable PMP education business.

The system addresses key market gaps by providing ECO-focused content (rather than generic PMBOK material), budget-conscious pricing, and authentic "candidate-to-candidate" positioning. Based on recent execution insights, the platform requires sophisticated content integration, educational quality assurance, and multi-platform community management capabilities.
