## Understanding the PMPÂ® Exam Format

Knowing the structure and logistics of the PMPÂ® exam is essential for effective preparation and time management on exam day. Here's what you need to know:

### Exam Content Breakdown

Based on the PMPÂ® Examination Content Outline (ECO), covering three domains:
- **People: 42% of questions** (Approximately 76 questions)
- **Process: 50% of questions** (Approximately 90 questions)  
- **Business Environment: 8% of questions** (Approximately 14 questions)

- **Exam Duration:** 230 minutes (3 hours and 50 minutes)
- **Breaks:** Two optional 10-minute breaks (after questions 60 and 120)

**Important:** A small number of questions are "pretest" questions used for future exam validation and do not count towards your score. You won't know which ones are pretest questions.

### Question Types You'll Encounter

The exam uses various question formats to assess your knowledge and application skills:

   - Select the single best answer from four options
   - Focus on situational scenarios requiring PMP mindset application

2. **Multiple-Response**

   - Common for processes, knowledge areas, or tools and techniques

4. **Hotspot**
   - Click on specific areas of graphics or diagrams
   - Often used for process flow or organizational charts

5. **Fill-in-the-Blank** (Less common)
