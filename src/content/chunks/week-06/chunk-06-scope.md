## II.8 Plan and Manage Scope

### Scope Management Fundamentals

Project scope management ensures that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully. It involves defining what is and is not included in the project and controlling changes to the project scope.

ðŸ§  **PMP Mindset:** Clear scope definition prevents scope creep and ensures stakeholder alignment. Project managers serve as guardians of scope while remaining flexible to necessary changes that add value.

### Scope Planning Process

#### Plan Scope Management

**Scope Management Plan Components**
- Process for preparing the project scope statement
- Process for creating, maintaining, and approving the WBS
- Process for obtaining formal acceptance of deliverables
- Process for controlling scope change requests
- Roles and responsibilities for scope management activities

**Key Planning Considerations**
- Organizational culture and stakeholder expectations
- Project methodology and development approach
- Requirements management and validation processes
- Change control and configuration management procedures
- Communication and documentation standards

#### Collect Requirements

**Requirements Categories**
- Business requirements and strategic objectives
- Stakeholder requirements and expectations
- Solution requirements and functional specifications
- Transition and readiness requirements
- Project requirements and constraints
- Quality requirements and acceptance criteria

**Requirements Gathering Techniques**
- Interviews and stakeholder consultations
- Focus groups and facilitated workshops
- Surveys and questionnaires
- Observation and job shadowing
- Document analysis and benchmarking
- Prototyping and proof of concepts

- Regular review and refinement
- Traceability to business objectives

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

#### WBS Development Principles

**Hierarchical Decomposition**
- Progressive breakdown of project work
- 100% rule - all work must be included
- Mutually exclusive work packages
- Appropriate level of detail for control
- Logical grouping and organization

**WBS Levels and Structure**
- Level 1: Project or major deliverables
- Level 2: Major work components or phases
- Level 3: Detailed work packages or activities
- Work package level: Manageable units of work
- Activity level: Specific tasks and actions

#### WBS Creation Techniques

**Top-Down Approach**
- Start with major deliverables or phases
- Progressively decompose into smaller components
- Ensure complete coverage of project scope
- Validate with stakeholders and team members
- Refine based on feedback and analysis

**Bottom-Up Approach**
- Identify all known activities and tasks
- Group related activities into work packages
- Organize work packages into higher-level components
- Validate completeness and logical structure
- Adjust based on project requirements

**Hybrid Approach**
- Combine top-down and bottom-up techniques
- Use templates and organizational standards
- Leverage lessons learned and best practices
- Adapt to project-specific requirements
- Iterate and refine through collaboration

#### WBS Dictionary

**Work Package Documentation**
- Unique identifier and descriptive name
- Statement of work and deliverable description
- Responsible organization and assigned resources
- Schedule milestones and duration estimates
- Cost estimates and budget allocation
- Quality requirements and acceptance criteria
- Technical requirements and specifications
- Assumptions and constraints

ðŸŽ¯ **Practice Application:** Complete the WBS development workshop from Day 36 video to practice decomposing project scope into manageable work packages.
