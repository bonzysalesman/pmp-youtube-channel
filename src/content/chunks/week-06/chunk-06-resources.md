## II.5 Plan and Manage Budget and Resources

### Cost Control and Performance Management

#### Earned Value Management (EVM)

**Key EVM Metrics**
- **Planned Value (PV):** Authorized budget for scheduled work
- **Earned Value (EV):** Budget for work actually performed
- **Actual Cost (AC):** Actual cost incurred for work performed
- **Budget at Completion (BAC):** Total planned budget
- **Estimate at Completion (EAC):** Expected total project cost

**Performance Indicators**
- **Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / AC**
- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV**
- **Cost Variance (CV) = EV - AC**
- **Schedule Variance (SV) = EV - PV**
- **To Complete Performance Index (TCPI) = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)**

**Forecasting Techniques**
- **EAC = BAC / CPI** (assuming current performance continues)
- **EAC = AC + (BAC - EV)** (assuming future work at planned rate)
- **EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (CPI Ã— SPI)]** (considering both cost and schedule)
- **EAC = AC + Bottom-up ETC** (detailed re-estimation)
