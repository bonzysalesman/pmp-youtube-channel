## II.6 Plan and Manage Schedule

### Schedule Management Fundamentals

Project schedule management includes the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project. It involves planning, developing, managing, and controlling the project schedule to ensure project completion within approved timeframes.

ðŸ§  **PMP Mindset:** Effective schedule management balances stakeholder expectations with realistic delivery capabilities. Project managers create achievable schedules while maintaining flexibility for necessary adjustments.

### Schedule Planning Process
