## Core Process Domain Concepts

### Project Integration Management

**Project Integration Principles**
- Coordinate all project management processes and activities
- Balance competing demands and trade-offs
- Ensure project alignment with organizational strategy
- Maintain holistic view of project success

**Key Integration Activities**
- Project charter development and authorization
- Project management plan development and integration
- Direct and manage project work execution
- Monitor and control project work performance
- Perform integrated change control
- Close project or phase systematically

### Earned Value Management (EVM)

**Core EVM Formulas**
- **Planned Value (PV):** Budgeted cost of work scheduled
- **Earned Value (EV):** Budgeted cost of work performed
- **Actual Cost (AC):** Actual cost of work performed

**Variance Analysis**
- **Schedule Variance (SV) = EV - PV**
  - Positive: Ahead of schedule
  - Negative: Behind schedule
- **Cost Variance (CV) = EV - AC**
  - Positive: Under budget
  - Negative: Over budget

**Performance Indices**
- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV**
  - >1.0: Ahead of schedule
  - <1.0: Behind schedule
- **Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / AC**
  - >1.0: Under budget
  - <1.0: Over budget

**Forecasting Formulas**
- **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**
  - EAC = BAC / CPI (assuming current performance continues)
  - EAC = AC + (BAC - EV) (assuming future work at planned rate)
  - EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (CPI Ã— SPI)] (considering both cost and schedule)
- **Estimate to Complete (ETC) = EAC - AC**
- **Variance at Completion (VAC) = BAC - EAC**

### Risk Management

**Risk Management Process**
- Plan Risk Management: Define approach and methodology
- Identify Risks: Determine what could affect the project
- Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis: Prioritize risks by probability and impact
- Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis: Numerically analyze high-priority risks
- Plan Risk Responses: Develop strategies to address risks
- Implement Risk Responses: Execute planned risk response strategies
- Monitor Risks: Track identified risks and identify new risks

**Risk Response Strategies**
- **Threats (Negative Risks):**
  - Avoid: Eliminate the risk or protect project from impact
  - Transfer: Shift risk ownership to third party
  - Mitigate: Reduce probability or impact of risk
  - Accept: Acknowledge risk and take no proactive action
- **Opportunities (Positive Risks):**
  - Exploit: Ensure opportunity occurs
  - Share: Allocate opportunity ownership to third party
  - Enhance: Increase probability or impact of opportunity
  - Accept: Take advantage if opportunity occurs

### Quality Management

**Quality Management Principles**
- Customer satisfaction through meeting requirements
- Prevention over inspection
- Continuous improvement and learning
- Management responsibility for quality
- Mutually beneficial supplier relationships

**Quality Processes**

- Control Quality: Monitor and measure project deliverables

**Quality Tools and Techniques**
- Cause and Effect Diagrams (Fishbone/Ishikawa)
- Control Charts for process monitoring
- Flowcharts for process analysis
- Histograms for data distribution
- Pareto Charts for problem prioritization
- Scatter Diagrams for correlation analysis
- Statistical sampling for quality control

### Change Management

**Integrated Change Control Process**
- Change request submission and documentation
- Change impact assessment and analysis
- Change Control Board (CCB) review and decision
- Change implementation and verification
- Change communication and documentation update

**Change Control Principles**
- All changes must go through formal change control
- Changes should be evaluated for impact on all project constraints
- Approved changes must be implemented and communicated
- Change control board has authority to approve/reject changes
- Configuration management ensures consistency

### Procurement Management

**Procurement Process Flow**
- Plan Procurement Management: Define procurement approach
- Conduct Procurements: Obtain seller responses and select sellers
- Control Procurements: Manage procurement relationships and performance

**Contract Types and Risk Allocation**
- **Fixed Price (FP):** Seller bears cost risk, buyer bears scope risk
- **Cost Reimbursable (CR):** Buyer bears cost risk, seller bears performance risk
- **Time and Materials (T&M):** Shared risk, suitable for small amounts or undefined work

**Procurement Documents**
- Request for Proposal (RFP): Detailed requirements and evaluation criteria
- Request for Quotation (RFQ): Price-focused procurement
- Request for Information (RFI): Information gathering from potential sellers

## Process Domain Exam Strategies

### Question Pattern Recognition

**Earned Value Management Questions**
- Identify given values (PV, EV, AC, BAC)
- Apply appropriate formulas for calculations
- Interpret results and performance indicators
- Make recommendations based on analysis

**Risk Management Scenarios**
- Identify risk type (threat or opportunity)
- Assess risk characteristics (probability, impact, timing)
- Select appropriate risk response strategy
- Consider secondary risks and residual risks

**Change Control Situations**
- Recognize need for formal change control process
- Evaluate change impact on project constraints

## Scenario-Based Practice

### Earned Value Management Scenario

**Situation:** A project has the following status at month 6:
- Budget at Completion (BAC): $100,000
- Planned Value (PV): $60,000
- Earned Value (EV): $50,000
- Actual Cost (AC): $55,000

**Calculations:**
- Schedule Variance (SV) = EV - PV = $50,000 - $60,000 = -$10,000 (behind schedule)
- Cost Variance (CV) = EV - AC = $50,000 - $55,000 = -$5,000 (over budget)
- Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV = $50,000 / $60,000 = 0.83 (behind schedule)
- Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / AC = $50,000 / $55,000 = 0.91 (over budget)
- Estimate at Completion (EAC) = BAC / CPI = $100,000 / 0.91 = $109,890

**Analysis:** Project is behind schedule and over budget, requiring corrective action.

### Risk Response Scenario

**Situation:** A software development project faces a risk that a key technology component may not be available on time, potentially delaying the project by 3 months.

**Analysis:**
- This is a negative risk (threat) to the project schedule
- High impact (3-month delay) requires proactive response
- Multiple response strategies could be considered

**Response Options:**
- **Avoid:** Change technology to eliminate dependency
- **Transfer:** Contract with vendor for guaranteed delivery
- **Mitigate:** Develop backup technology or parallel development
- **Accept:** Acknowledge risk and develop contingency plan

### Change Control Scenario

**Situation:** During project execution, a stakeholder requests additional functionality that would increase project scope by 20% and extend timeline by 2 months.

**Analysis:**
- Significant scope change requiring formal change control
- Impact assessment needed for all project constraints
- Change Control Board decision required
- Stakeholder communication and expectation management needed

**Process Steps:**
1. Document change request formally
2. Assess impact on scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, and risks
3. Present to Change Control Board with recommendation
4. Communicate decision to all stakeholders
5. Update project documents if approved
