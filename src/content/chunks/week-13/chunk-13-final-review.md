## Final Week Strategy

The final week before your PMP exam is crucial for consolidating knowledge, building confidence, and ensuring optimal performance. This week should focus on light review, confidence building, and mental preparation rather than intensive new learning.

### Final Week Principles

**Confidence Over Cramming**

- Focus on reinforcing strengths rather than learning new material
- Maintain positive mindset and self-confidence
- Avoid intensive studying that may increase anxiety

**Quality Over Quantity**

- Focus on weak areas identified through practice exams
- Use active recall and spaced repetition techniques
- Maintain consistent but manageable study schedule

**Rest and Recovery**
- Ensure adequate sleep and physical recovery
- Manage stress through relaxation and exercise
- Maintain healthy nutrition and hydration
- Balance study with enjoyable activities

### Daily Study Plan for Final Week

**Days 1-3: Targeted Review**
- Morning (2 hours): Practice questions in weak areas
- Afternoon (1 hour): Formula review and quick reference creation
- Evening (30 minutes): Light reading of key concepts

**Days 4-5: Light Review and Confidence Building**
- Morning (1 hour): Mixed practice questions across all domains
- Afternoon (30 minutes): Review of key formulas and concepts
- Evening: Relaxation and positive visualization

**Days 6-7: Minimal Study and Preparation**
- Day 6: Light review of key concepts and formulas only
- Day 7 (Exam Day): No intensive study, focus on logistics and mindset

## Strategic Review Areas

### High-Impact Concepts for Final Review

**People Domain Quick Review**
- Conflict resolution techniques and selection criteria
- Leadership styles and situational application
- Team development stages and appropriate interventions
- Stakeholder engagement strategies and power/interest analysis
- Emotional intelligence domains and practical application

**Process Domain Quick Review**

### Formula Quick Reference

**Earned Value Management**
- SV = EV - PV (Schedule Variance)
- CV = EV - AC (Cost Variance)
- SPI = EV / PV (Schedule Performance Index)
- CPI = EV / AC (Cost Performance Index)
- EAC = BAC / CPI (Estimate at Completion)
- ETC = EAC - AC (Estimate to Complete)
- VAC = BAC - EAC (Variance at Completion)

**Schedule Analysis**
- Float = LS - ES or LF - EF
- Critical Path: Longest path through network, zero float
- Schedule compression: Crashing (add resources) vs Fast tracking (parallel activities)

**Quality Control**
- Control limits typically Â±3 sigma from mean
- Rule of Seven: Seven consecutive points on one side of mean
- Upper Control Limit (UCL) and Lower Control Limit (LCL)
