## III.2 Evaluate and Deliver Project Benefits and Value

### Benefits Management Fundamentals

Benefits management is the process of identifying, planning, measuring, and tracking benefits from the start of the program or project investment until realization of the last projected benefit. It ensures that projects deliver the intended business value and contribute to organizational success.
