## II.15 Manage Project Issues

### Issue Management Fundamentals

Project issue management involves identifying, analyzing, and resolving problems that occur during project execution. Issues are current problems that can impact project objectives and require immediate attention, unlike risks which are potential future problems.

ðŸ§  **PMP Mindset:** Issues are opportunities for improvement and learning. Project managers approach problems with curiosity and systematic thinking, focusing on root causes and sustainable solutions.

### Issue Identification and Classification

#### Issue vs. Risk Distinction

**Issues (Current Problems)**
- **Characteristics:** Already occurring, immediate impact, requires action now
- **Examples:** Team member unavailable, vendor delivery delay, budget overrun, quality defect
- **Management Approach:** Immediate response, problem-solving, corrective action
- **Timeline:** Current situation requiring immediate attention and resolution

**Risks (Potential Problems)**
- **Characteristics:** May occur in future, uncertain probability, preventive planning possible
- **Examples:** Key team member might leave, vendor might fail, budget might be cut
- **Management Approach:** Prevention, mitigation planning, contingency preparation
- **Timeline:** Future possibility requiring proactive planning and monitoring

#### Issue Categories and Types
