## I.4 Empower Team Members & Stakeholders

### Understanding Empowerment vs. Delegation

#### Traditional Delegation Model

**Characteristics:**

- Manager retains control and oversight of all activities

**When Appropriate:**

- High-risk activities requiring close supervision
- Time-critical situations with no room for error
- Regulatory or compliance-sensitive tasks

#### Empowerment Model

**Characteristics:**

- Focus on outcomes and results rather than specific methods
- Emphasis on capability building and professional development
- Manager serves as coach and resource provider

**Benefits:**
- Increased team motivation and engagement

- Enhanced innovation and creative problem-solving
- Improved team resilience and adaptability

ðŸ§  **PMP Mindset:** Servant leaders empower others by providing support, removing obstacles, and creating conditions for success rather than controlling activities.

### The Empowerment Spectrum

#### Level 3: Joint Decision-Making

- Collective ownership of outcomes and consequences
- Balanced consideration of multiple perspectives

**Example:** Working together to determine project approach and methodology.

#### Level 4: Full Empowerment
- Team members have complete authority within defined boundaries
- Manager provides resources and support but doesn't direct activities
- Team is accountable for results and has freedom to determine methods
- Manager focuses on obstacle removal and capability development

**Example:** Self-organizing agile teams with authority to plan and execute sprints.
