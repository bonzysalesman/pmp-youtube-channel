## I.6 Build A Team

### Team Formation Fundamentals

Building effective project teams goes beyond simply assigning people to tasks. As a project manager with the PMP mindset, you're responsible for creating an environment where diverse individuals can collaborate effectively to deliver project value.

ðŸŽ¥ **Watch Week 2 Intro Video:** See the complete team formation process with a remote team case study showing psychological safety in action.

### Tuckman's Team Development Model

**Forming Stage:**
- Team members are introduced and begin to understand project objectives
- Individuals are polite but may be anxious about their roles
- High dependence on leader for guidance and direction

**PMP Application:** Establish clear expectations, provide comprehensive project overview, and begin relationship building activities.

**Storming Stage:**
- Team members begin to express individual opinions and challenge approaches
- Conflicts may arise over work styles, priorities, or methodologies
- Some team members may question the project approach or leadership

**PMP Application:** Facilitate open communication, address conflicts constructively, and reinforce shared project goals. This is where ground rules become critical.

**Norming Stage:**
- Team develops working agreements and establishes collaborative patterns
- Roles and responsibilities become clearer and accepted
- Team begins to develop trust and mutual respect

**PMP Application:** Reinforce positive behaviors, celebrate early wins, and ensure team ground rules are being followed consistently.

**Performing Stage:**
- Team operates efficiently with minimal supervision
- Members support each other and work collaboratively toward shared goals
- High levels of trust, communication, and productivity

**PMP Application:** Focus on removing impediments, providing resources, and maintaining team motivation through recognition and development opportunities.

**Adjourning Stage:**
- Project completion and team dissolution
- Recognition of achievements and lessons learned capture
- Transition planning for team members' next assignments

**PMP Application:** Conduct thorough project retrospectives, document lessons learned, and support team members' career development and transition planning.

### Diversity and Inclusion Benefits

**Cognitive Diversity:**
- Different problem-solving approaches and perspectives
- Enhanced creativity and innovation in solution development
- Reduced groupthink and improved decision-making quality

**Cultural Diversity:**
- Global perspective essential for international projects
- Cultural sensitivity in stakeholder engagement
- Language skills and local market knowledge

**Functional Diversity:**
- Cross-functional expertise and knowledge sharing
- Reduced silos and improved integration
- Enhanced risk identification from multiple viewpoints

**PMP Mindset Application:** Actively seek diverse team composition and create inclusive environments where all perspectives are valued and heard.

### Psychological Safety Framework

Psychological safety is the belief that team members can express ideas, concerns, and mistakes without fear of negative consequences.

**Creating Psychological Safety:**
1. **Model Vulnerability:** Admit your own mistakes and uncertainties
2. **Ask for Feedback:** Regularly seek input on your leadership and project approach
3. **Respond Constructively:** Thank people for raising concerns or admitting errors
4. **Establish Learning Orientation:** Frame challenges as learning opportunities

**Indicators of Psychological Safety:**
- Team members freely ask questions and admit mistakes
- Constructive disagreement and debate occur regularly
- People offer ideas and suggestions without prompting
- Team members support each other during difficulties

ðŸŽ¯ **Practice Application:** Complete the psychological safety assessment in your Week 2 intro video to evaluate your current team environment.

## I.12 Define Team Ground Rules

### Ground Rule Categories

**Communication Ground Rules:**
- Meeting participation expectations and protocols
- Response time requirements for emails and messages
- Escalation procedures for urgent issues
- Documentation and information sharing standards

**Example:** "All team members will respond to project emails within 24 hours during business days, with urgent items marked clearly in subject line."

**Decision-Making Ground Rules:**
- Decision-making authority and approval processes
- Consensus-building approaches for team decisions
- Conflict resolution procedures and escalation paths
- Change request handling and approval workflows

**Example:** "Technical decisions within approved scope can be made by subject matter experts with team notification. Scope changes require project manager approval and stakeholder consultation."

**Meeting Ground Rules:**
- Start and end times with punctuality expectations
- Agenda distribution and preparation requirements
- Participation guidelines and speaking protocols
- Technology use policies (phones, laptops, etc.)

**Example:** "Meetings start promptly at scheduled time. Latecomers will not be brought up to speed during the meeting. All phones on silent with emergency exceptions communicated in advance."

**Work Quality Ground Rules:**
- Definition of done criteria for deliverables
- Review and approval processes for work products
- Quality standards and acceptance criteria
- Rework and correction procedures

**Example:** "All deliverables must pass peer review before client presentation. Reviewers have 48 hours to provide feedback. Authors have 24 hours to address comments before final submission."

ðŸŽ¥ **Watch Day 8 Video:** See detailed examples of each ground rule category with real project scenarios and enforcement techniques.

### Ground Rule Development Process

**Step 1: Collaborative Development**
- Involve entire team in ground rule creation
- Use facilitated sessions to gather input and build consensus
- Ensure all team members have opportunity to contribute
- Document agreements clearly and specifically

**Step 2: Documentation and Communication**
- Create written team charter or ground rules document
- Ensure all team members receive and acknowledge rules
- Post ground rules in visible team workspace
- Include ground rules in new team member orientation

**Step 3: Regular Review and Adjustment**
- Schedule periodic ground rule review sessions
- Adjust rules based on team feedback and project evolution
- Address violations promptly and consistently
- Celebrate adherence and positive team behaviors

### Ground Rule Enforcement Strategies

**Positive Reinforcement:**
- Recognize team members who model ground rule adherence
- Celebrate team achievements that result from good collaboration
- Share success stories of effective ground rule application
- Provide development opportunities for strong team contributors

**Constructive Correction:**
- Address violations privately first, then escalate if necessary
- Focus on behavior impact rather than personal criticism
- Involve team in problem-solving for persistent issues
- Document patterns of violations for performance discussions

**Escalation Procedures:**
- Clear steps for addressing repeated violations
- Involvement of functional managers when appropriate
- Project sponsor engagement for serious team issues
- HR consultation for behavioral or performance problems

### Team Charter Development

A team charter formalizes the team's purpose, roles, and operating agreements.

**Essential Charter Elements:**
1. **Project Purpose and Objectives:** Clear statement of what the team is trying to achieve
2. **Team Member Roles and Responsibilities:** Specific accountabilities for each team member
3. **Communication Protocols:** How, when, and what the team will communicate
4. **Decision-Making Authority:** Who can make what decisions and approval processes
5. **Meeting Schedules and Protocols:** Regular meeting cadence and operating procedures
6. **Ground Rules and Operating Agreements:** Behavioral expectations and work standards
7. **Success Metrics:** How the team will measure and celebrate success

ðŸŽ¯ **Practice Session:** Use the team charter template from Day 8 video to create a charter for a sample project scenario.

### Virtual Team Considerations

**Additional Ground Rules for Remote Teams:**
- Camera use expectations for video calls
- Time zone considerations and core collaboration hours
- Technology platform standards and backup procedures
- Informal communication and relationship building activities

**Cross-Domain Connection:** See chunk-03-virtual-teams.md for detailed virtual team engagement strategies in People domain.

### Common Ground Rule Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too Many Rules**
- Problem: Overwhelming team with excessive restrictions
- Solution: Focus on 5-7 critical areas that impact team effectiveness

**Mistake 2: Vague Language**
- Problem: Rules that are open to interpretation
- Solution: Use specific, measurable, and actionable language

**Mistake 3: Top-Down Imposition**
- Problem: Manager-created rules without team input
- Solution: Collaborative development with team ownership

**Mistake 4: No Enforcement**
- Problem: Rules exist but violations are ignored
- Solution: Consistent, fair enforcement with positive and corrective approaches

### Exam Strategy for Team Building Content

**Common Question Patterns:**
- Scenarios involving team conflict during different formation stages
- Situations requiring ground rule establishment or enforcement
- Diversity and inclusion challenges in team composition
- Virtual team management and communication issues

**PMP Mindset Application:**
- Always choose collaborative over authoritative approaches
- Focus on team empowerment and development
- Prioritize psychological safety and inclusive practices
- Address root causes rather than symptoms
