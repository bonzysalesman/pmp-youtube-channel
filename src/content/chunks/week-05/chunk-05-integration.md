## II.9 Integrate Project Planning Activities

### Project Integration Management Fundamentals

Project integration management is the coordination of all project management processes and activities to ensure the project works as a unified whole. It involves making trade-offs among competing objectives and alternatives to meet stakeholder requirements and expectations.

ðŸ§  **PMP Mindset:** Integration thinking considers the whole system rather than individual parts. Project managers serve as integrators who ensure all elements work together harmoniously to deliver value.

- Resource availability and constraint assessment
- Stakeholder expectation management and alignment
- Risk and assumption documentation and validation

#### Develop Project Management Plan

**Plan Integration Framework**
