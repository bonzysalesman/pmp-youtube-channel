## II.13 Determine Appropriate Project Methodology/Methods and Practices

### Methodology Selection Fundamentals

Project methodology selection is a critical decision that impacts how the project will be planned, executed, and controlled. The choice must align with project characteristics, organizational culture, stakeholder preferences, and environmental factors.

ðŸ§  **PMP Mindset:** There is no one-size-fits-all methodology. Effective project managers select and tailor approaches based on project context, stakeholder needs, and organizational capabilities.

### Understanding Project Methodologies

#### Predictive (Waterfall) Methodology

**Characteristics**
- Sequential phases with defined gates and deliverables
- Detailed upfront planning and requirements definition
- Formal change control and scope management
- Emphasis on documentation and process compliance

**When to Use Predictive Approaches**
- Well-defined and stable requirements
- Regulatory or compliance-driven environments
- Large, complex projects with multiple stakeholders
- Organizations with mature project management processes
- High-risk projects requiring detailed planning and control

**Advantages**
- Clear project structure and predictable outcomes
- Comprehensive documentation and traceability
- Strong governance and control mechanisms
- Suitable for fixed-price contracts and formal procurement

**Disadvantages**
- Limited flexibility for changing requirements
- Late delivery of working solutions
- Higher risk of delivering unwanted features
- Potential for scope creep and change requests

#### Agile Methodology

**Characteristics**
- Iterative and incremental development approach
- Collaborative and adaptive planning processes
- Working software delivery in short cycles
- Emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes

**Core Agile Principles**
- Customer collaboration and frequent feedback
- Responding to change over following a plan
- Working solutions over comprehensive documentation
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

**When to Use Agile Approaches**
- Uncertain or evolving requirements
- Need for rapid delivery and frequent feedback
- Innovative or experimental projects
- Small, co-located, cross-functional teams
- Organizations with collaborative culture

**Advantages**
- High adaptability and responsiveness to change
- Early and frequent delivery of value
- Strong customer involvement and satisfaction
- Reduced risk through iterative validation

**Disadvantages**
- Requires significant cultural and organizational change
- Challenging for large, distributed teams
- Difficult to predict final scope and cost
- May lack comprehensive documentation

ðŸŽ¥ **Watch Day 30 Video:** See methodology selection framework applied to real project scenarios with decision criteria and trade-off analysis.

#### Hybrid Methodology

**Characteristics**
