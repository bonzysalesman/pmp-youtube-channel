## II.7 Plan and Manage Quality of Products/Deliverables

### Quality Management Fundamentals

Project quality management includes the processes for incorporating the organization's quality policy regarding planning, managing, and controlling project and product quality requirements to meet stakeholder expectations and ensure fitness for use.

ðŸ§  **PMP Mindset:** Quality is everyone's responsibility, not just the quality department. Project managers create systems and culture that build quality into processes rather than inspecting it in at the end.
