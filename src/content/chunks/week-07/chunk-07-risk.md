## II.3 Assess and Manage Risks

### Risk Management Fundamentals

Project risk management includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis, response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project. Risk management aims to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of negative events.

ðŸ§  **PMP Mindset:** Effective risk management is proactive rather than reactive. Project managers identify and address risks early, turning uncertainty into competitive advantage through systematic risk management.
