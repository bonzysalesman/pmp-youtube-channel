## I.7 Address & Remove Impediments, Obstacles, & Blockers for the Team

### Understanding Impediments in Project Context

Impediments are barriers that prevent the team from performing their work effectively or achieving project objectives. As a servant leader, the project manager's role is to identify, address, and remove these obstacles to enable team success.

ðŸ§  **PMP Mindset:** Servant leaders focus on removing barriers and creating conditions for team success rather than directing activities. The project manager serves as a shield and advocate for the team.

### Types of Impediments and Obstacles

#### Organizational Impediments

**Bureaucratic Barriers**
- Excessive approval processes and red tape
- Rigid policies and procedures that don't fit project needs
- Multiple layers of decision-making and sign-offs
- Conflicting organizational priorities and initiatives

**Examples:**
- IT security policies that prevent necessary tool access
- Procurement processes that delay critical resource acquisition
- Budget approval cycles that don't align with project timelines
- Organizational restructuring that affects team stability

**Resource Constraints**
- Insufficient budget allocation and funding limitations
- Lack of skilled personnel and expertise gaps
- Equipment and technology shortages
- Facility and workspace limitations

**Examples:**
- Budget cuts that affect project scope or quality
- Key team members assigned to competing priorities
- Outdated technology that limits productivity
- Inadequate workspace for team collaboration

**Political and Cultural Barriers**
- Competing departmental interests and territorial behavior
- Resistance to change and status quo maintenance
- Power struggles and influence conflicts
- Cultural misalignment and value differences

**Examples:**
- Department heads protecting their resources and people
- Resistance from groups affected by project outcomes
- Competing projects vying for same resources
- Cultural differences in global or diverse teams
